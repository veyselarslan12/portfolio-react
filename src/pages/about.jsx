            Hello! I‚Äôm Veysel Arslan, a 26-year-old full-stack web developer
            currently living in Chicago, USA. I born and raised in Turkey üáπüá∑ ‚ù§Ô∏è.
            <br />
            <br />
            I embarked on a journey from a Civil Engineering background to the
            dynamic world of web development. My love for coding has driven me
            to explore and create within this exciting field.
            <br />
            I specialize in building innovative solutions and have a particular
            passion for artificial intelligence. Over the years, I've developed
            several projects that reflect my commitment to learning and growth.
            This portfolio is a glimpse into my work and the projects I'm proud
            to share. Feel free to explore my creations and delve into the
            source code on my GitHub.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you for visiting!
