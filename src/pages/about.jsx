            Hello! I’m Veysel Arslan, a 26-year-old full-stack web developer
            currently residing in Chicago, USA. Originally from Turkey.
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              I embarked on a journey from a Civil Engineering background to the
              dynamic world of web development. My love for coding has driven me
              to explore and create within this exciting field.
            </p>
            <br />
            I specialize in building innovative solutions and have a particular
            passion for artificial intelligence. Over the years, I've developed
            several projects that reflect my commitment to learning and growth.
            This portfolio is a glimpse into my work and the projects I'm proud
            to share. Feel free to explore my creations and delve into the
            source code on my GitHub.
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
